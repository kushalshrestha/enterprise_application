The application still works when the fetch type is set to LAZY and @Transactional annotation is added because the method or class will be executed within a  transaction although the entity is set to LAZY. The entity loads only after it is accessed, however since it will be treated as a part of transaction there won't be any issue. Eg: The deposit() method in Service Layer makes first request on the database to find the account using findById() method, and then makes a request to deposit the amount using deposit() method.
