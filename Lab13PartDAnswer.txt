Suppose you need to test the current Bank application. Elaborate what elements of the
application you need to test. In other words, how would you test this application? 

- Here's the following things that I would do:
1. Write Unit Test for all the entity class, repository, services and controllers.
2. Write Positive and Negative test cases
3. Perform manual/semi-automation/automation on the written test cases
4. Use Test Case Management tools to manage the test cases.
5. Once the unit test are tested, perform other sort of testing like integration testing, regression testing
6. Perform non functional tests like: User Experience Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Performance Testing etc
